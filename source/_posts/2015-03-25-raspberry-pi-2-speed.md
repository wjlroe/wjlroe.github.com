I just benchmarked my new [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B][] against my old
[Raspberry Pi 1 Model B][] using the
[ClojureScript Quick Start Guide][] (specifically timing the build
step):

<!--more-->

    time java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main build.clj

On the [Raspberry Pi 1 Model B][] this takes 61.59 seconds, whereas on
the new [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B][] this takes 18.42 seconds!

For comparison, on my MacBook Air (11-inch, Mid 2013, 1.4 GHz Intel
Core i5, 8GB RAM), while lots of software was running, so not a
complete fair test (the Pis were booted up into the console, not even
running X) this takes 5.75 seconds.

Considering the difference in specifications of these machines, the
Raspberry Pi 2 is remarkably fast. I could even load up and play with
[Sonic Pi][] pretty quickly (on the original Model B that took long
enough to make a cup of tea).

Looks like I'm going to be drinking less tea in the future.
