In my last post on the subject, I described one way to solve a simple
Secret Santa problem using core.logic. In this post I will complicate
things shamelessly so that our algorithm can cope in the real world.

## Grouped Secret Santa

Sometimes there are groups of people who shouldn't be paired up in a
Secret Santa because they will already be exchanging presents, perhaps
members of somebody's immediate family. This makes pairing up gift
givers and receivers considerably more complicated and a solution is
not guaranteed.
