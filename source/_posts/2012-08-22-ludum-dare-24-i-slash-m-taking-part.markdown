I shall be making an attempt to build a game in 48 hours for [Ludum Dare 24](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/), for the first time.

My tools will be:

* **Language**: Clojure + ClojureScript (targeting Javascript)
* **Engine**: My brain and HTML Canvas...mainly canvas
* **Libraries**: probably at least [Monet](https://github.com/ibdknox/monet)
* **Music**: I have no idea, whatever I can work out how to use
* **Graphics**: Pixen, Pixelmator, that sort of thing probably

I'm gonna have fun but since I'm breaking rule 1 - know the tools (I don't know any possible tools) this is going to be intense.

Have fun everyone!
