It's very easy to get discouraged. It's very common to feel that
you're just not that good at what you do (and just as common to feel
you're
[great at it when you're not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)).
These days, if you're trying to develop a skill, a wealth of
information is available to you. Looking for online tutorials? Just
search YouTube - there are a
[LOT of them](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+tie+a+tie&oq=how+to+tie+&gs_l=youtube-reduced.3.0.0l4.1463720.1465261.0.1468051.11.8.0.1.1.1.224.1247.1j5j2.8.0...0.0...1ac.mmjK6IUFyHs).
Want to teach others something? That is
[covered](http://www.udemy.com/).

The experts that inspire you have never been nearer. You can watch
their videos, read their blog and even get updates into the minutinae
of their daily lives on Twitter. This is mostly awesome. It humanises
your heros for one thing, which is very healthy - they make mistakes,
they get bored, they say silly things - that's if they 'get' social
media.

But there is a dark side. Now it is even easier to see experts doing
what they do best. Often, this can impress upon you just how great
they are and just how terrible you are. If you are watching the
finished product of years of experience, hard work and (perhaps) just
a little talent then it is very difficult to bear that in mind when
looking at your own achievements.

That is all quite abstract so let's get to some examples that apply to
me. Perhaps they might apply to you (if you're interested in
programming games, taking good photographs, writing music or playing
music) - but the unifying theme is simply creativity. If you want to
paint something amazing, I bet you could be plagued with the same
feelings of inadiquacy and the crushing sense of the daunting task
before you.



Here's an extract from an upcoming documentary about [Mojang](http://mojang.com), showing Notch talking about programming games:

I love those pieces so very very much. I love it so much, let's have the first movement because... it's just the best:
