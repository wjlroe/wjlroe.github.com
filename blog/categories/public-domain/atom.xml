    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to release your music for everybody to hear then it&#8217;s a good idea to
licence it with a creative commons licence. That way your music or drawings can
be remixed and used in surprising ways.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>But the emphasis on the finished product doesn&#8217;t interest me as much. I&#8217;d rather
open source the process by which art is made rather than the result.</p>

<p>The new wave of digitally assembled music opens the way to truly open source
music - when music can have source code, can have a version history - we can all
learn from how it gets made.</p>

<p>Put your music in the public domain if you like, but don&#8217;t forget to release the
things you learned along the way.</p>
