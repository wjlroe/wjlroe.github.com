    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s very easy to get discouraged. It&#8217;s very common to feel that
you&#8217;re just not that good at what you do (and just as common to feel
you&#8217;re
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">great at it when you&#8217;re not</a>).
These days, if you&#8217;re trying to develop a skill, a wealth of
information is available to you. Looking for online tutorials? Just
search YouTube - there are a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+tie+a+tie&amp;oq=how+to+tie+&amp;gs_l=youtube-reduced.3.0.0l4.1463720.1465261.0.1468051.11.8.0.1.1.1.224.1247.1j5j2.8.0...0.0...1ac.mmjK6IUFyHs">LOT of them</a>.
Want to teach others something? That is
<a href="http://www.udemy.com/">covered</a>.</p>

<p>The experts that inspire you have never been nearer. You can watch
their videos, read their blog and even get updates into the minutinae
of their daily lives on Twitter. This is mostly awesome. It humanises
your heros for one thing, which is very healthy - they make mistakes,
they get bored, they say silly things - that&#8217;s if they &#8216;get&#8217; social
media.</p>

<p>But there is a dark side. Now it is even easier to see experts doing
what they do best. Often, this can impress upon you just how great
they are and just how terrible you are. If you are watching the
finished product of years of experience, hard work and (perhaps) just
a little talent then it is very difficult to bear that in mind when
looking at your own achievements.</p>

<p>That is all quite abstract so let&#8217;s get to some examples that apply to
me. Perhaps they might apply to you (if you&#8217;re interested in
programming games, taking good photographs, writing music or playing
music) - but the unifying theme is simply creativity. If you want to
paint something amazing, I bet you could be plagued with the same
feelings of inadiquacy and the crushing sense of the daunting task
before you.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an extract from an upcoming documentary about <a href="http://mojang.com">Mojang</a>, showing Notch talking about programming games:</p>

    <id>http://blog.wjlr.org.uk/2015/03/23/serial-micro-piano-trio-no-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first &#8220;released&#8221; (algorithmically generated) composition is a micro
piano trio in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialism">serialist</a> style.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It all started when I borrowed the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3150827-simple-composition">Simple Composition</a> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wuorinen">Charles Wuorinen</a> from the Sussex University library (I was
studying Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence at the time, some
years ago).</p>

<p><figure class="img fillwidth"><img src="http://blog.wjlr.org.uk/images/University_of_Sussex_Library.jpg" alt="Sussex Uni Library" title="Sussex Uni Library"><figcaption>Sussex University Library &#8211; Photo Public Domain, Wikipedia, Filtered</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>This book explains the basics of composing in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique">twelve tone technique</a> created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a>. Some days
ago I started playing around with the concepts from that book in
<a href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a>. It was a lot of fun.</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I might be playing with <a href="https://twitter.com/overtone">@overtone</a> possibly <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/clojure?src=hash">#clojure</a> <a href="http://t.co/8KRPc2qmpr">pic.twitter.com/8KRPc2qmpr</a></p>&mdash; Will Roe (@wjlroe) <a href="https://twitter.com/wjlroe/status/575775558082150402">March 11, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with twelve-tone composition or serialism in
music, you could do a lot worse than to watch this awesome video by
<a href="http://vihart.com">ViHart</a>:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4niz8TfY794" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>The code</h2>

<p>I used a library called <a href="https://github.com/ctford/leipzig">Leipzig</a> written by <a href="http://literateprogrammer.blogspot.co.uk/">Chris Ford</a> to build
up the composition from an initial tone row (a set of 12 integers),
via several functional transformations of the tone row and into 3
instrumental parts: piano, violin and cello.</p>

<p>Since this piece uses a randomly-generated tone row and
randomly-generated sequence of both note duration and playing style
(vibrato, non-vibrato or pizzicato),
it&#8217;s not actually reproducible from the code. The code is useful
mainly for encoding the basic form of the piece and the parameters
of the work (such as instruments, length of the piece, which elements
are random and which aren&#8217;t etc.).</p>

<p>In future I will work out some way to capture the notes being
generated. The simplest way to do this would be to save all the
structures produced by the <code>piano-trio</code> function into an <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn">EDN</a> file,
which could be trivially played back at a later date. Transformation
of that data into traditional musical notation wouldn&#8217;t be too tricky
either.</p>

<p>The structure of this piece consists of 3 instrumental parts played in
parallel. The main function is
<a href="https://github.com/wjlroe/serial/blob/micro-piano-trio-1/src/serial/twelve_tone.clj#L200-L213"><code>piano-trio</code></a>
and is inline below:</p>

<pre><code class="clojure">(defn piano-trio
  [bpm tone-row]
  (in-tempo
   bpm
   (with
    (-&gt;&gt; (total-serial tone-row)
         (play-on :cello)
         (serial-style :cello))
    (-&gt;&gt; (total-serial tone-row)
         (play-on :violin)
         (serial-style :violin))
    (-&gt;&gt; (total-serial tone-row)
         (play-on :piano)
         (serial-style :piano)))))
</code></pre>

<p>The most interesting aspect as it relates to musical transformation is
the definition of retrograde, inversion and retrograde-inversion:</p>

<pre><code class="clojure">(defn retrograde
  [row]
  (reverse row))

(defn inversion
  [row]
  (map - row))

(def retrograde-inversion
  (comp retrograde inversion))
</code></pre>

<p>It was for this reason - the applicability of pure functions and
functional composition - that I felt <a href="http://overtone.github.io/">overtone</a> and Clojure were such a
good fit for writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialism">serialist</a> music. It&#8217;s even more applicable to
12-tone composition than tonal (diatonic) music since the rules are so
much more mechanistic.</p>

<h2>The recording</h2>

<p>I had a lot of fun exploring serialism through Overtone and the
Leipzig library. I was inspired to release this little track and to
spend more time on code like this when I watched a great talk called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kovJHzQNsg0">Make Art, Not Apps</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisIsJohnBrown">@ThisIsJohnBrown</a>.</p>
